# Kubernetes

K8s is the most common orchestration system, and is often used and tested for devops and backend roles.

## Source Materials

Estimated prepping time for certification: +60 hours
- The [Linux Foundation course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-developers/) is the most legitimate course out there. The Linux Foundation runs several certifications like CKAD. The course content is good but the format is not great.
- [Killer.sh](https://killer.sh/) this is a K8s certification training platform. The challenges are significantly harder than the real test - if you pass it here, you *will pass the test*
